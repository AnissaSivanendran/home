					<br> I'm a proud Canadian being born in Canada, while my parents were born in Sri Lanka. A fun but sad fact is that
					I've never been on an airplane so I've never visited Sri Lanka. An even sadder fact is that I've never gone out of Ontario,
					only having ventured around some areas a little farther than Toronto.

					<!--Content for History of Previous Schools-->
					I've gone to 3 schools in total, including VPCI, and if I count preschool the number of schools I've attended increases to 4 schools.
					I actually don't remember the name of my preschool but I think I went to the preschool for around 2 years and one of my most memorable memories there
					was my friend and I arguing over who got the better gift from santa &#x28;and I still think to this day that my gift was better&#x29;.
					<h3> First School: Thorncliffe Park Public School</h3> 	<!--Content for the First School-->
					The only elementary school I went to is Thorncliffe Park Public School, from JK to grade 5, so I spent around half my life at Thorncliffe Park Public School,
					which made it a lot sadder when leaving the school and going to middle school. Although I'm in grade 9, I still think about all the nostalgic memories at Thorncliffe
					Park Public School and my friends from elementary school. When I was going to Thorncliffe Park Public School, I joined a bunch of clubs/teams from the choir to the volleyball team.
					I think that when I was attending Thorncliffe Park Public School there were around 2000 students overall each year, so it's a pretty big school. For the most part, I think Thorncliffe Park Public School was a
					good school and one day I wish to visit the school again.

					<h3>Second School: Gordon A Brown - GAB</h3>  <!--Content for the Second School-->
					<br> In grade 5 I took the gifted test and after passing it I decided to join the gifted program in grade 6 and go to Gordon A Brown instead of my home middle school. At
					first I wasn't really all that happy about going to a school where I don't know anyone but I'm ready glad I decided to go to Gordon A Brown because I was able to meet
					some very special people and many great teachers. Although the first month was a bit awkward, I found the most amazing friends who I cherish so much. A good thing
					about being in gifted was that only people in gifted can be in my class, so the people in my class were normally the same people each year and that made class a lot more comfortable.
					In grade 6, I joined yearbook committee and volunteered for a few events at GAB,  while in grade 7 I joined band, TDSB creates - spoken word, library helpers, heritage club and some other clubs
					and finally in grade 8 I joined heritage club and band again. Throughout my years at GAB, I learned how to swim a little since the school has a pool, although I'm still pretty bad
					at swimming I'm not as likely to drown now. My experience at GAB was mostly positive and I was able to learn so much while attending the school so I'm very thankful to the school.
					It was also really nice to have the same teacher &#x28;who is an amazing teacher&#x29; in both grade 6 and grade 8, and my grade 7 teachers were also really good and taught me a lot. Middle school is probably
					where I started to interact with others more and also raise my voice more often at certain people. I honestly think I was really lucky to go to Gordon A Brown and meet all	
					all my precious friends, classmates and teachers. 
					<h3>Third School: Victoria Park Collegiate Institute</h3> <!--Content for the Third School-->
					<br> The third and final school I'm currently attending is VPCI, as most of you know. It's only been a few months since I first started to go to VPCI and although coronavirus also made
					school a lot more confusing, from what I've seen it seems like a good school, and the teachers I've had so far are also really nice. I hope that I will continue to have a great
					experience at VPCI, make some friends and build good relationships with my peers.
